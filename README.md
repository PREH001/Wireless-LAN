# Wireless LAN Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation project demonstrating the setup of a **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**. The project file (`Wireless Lan.pkt`) showcases how wireless devices connect and communicate within a local area network using a wireless router and client devices.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this simulation is to model a **basic wireless LAN environment** where multiple devices (laptops, PCs, smartphones, or IoT devices) connect to a wireless router to access network resources and potentially connect to the internet via a simulated router.

Key concepts covered:
- Wireless Router configuration  
- Device wireless interface setup (SSID, security, DHCP/static IP)  
- Communication between wireless and wired devices  
- Basic troubleshooting using simulation tools (e.g., `ping`)

## ðŸ›  Requirements

To open and run the project, youâ€™ll need:

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (version 7.3 or later recommended)  
- A basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addressing, SSID configuration, wireless security)
